                        <p class="lead">Hello everyone, my name is Claire Daniels. I am a retired chef, a food fanatic and (of course) a food blogger. My deep love and passion for good food of all cultures and nationalities has led me to many different and beautiful parts of the world from the scenic beaches of Peru to the Eiffel Tower of Paris. I have always been a big believer in the idea that to know a people you have to know their food and so on this blog I bring my journey straight to you so as to make it easier for you, when you find yourself in these amazing cities. I share and review the top dishes I've had the pleasures of relishing. I hope you enjoy it and always feel free to send an e-mail for "delicacies" you've encountered on your "foodie journey" that you'd like for me to review</p>

                              <p>These roasted meats and fish on skewers are hard not to like. As the name suggests, 
                              this dish is a form of shish kebab, although, the Russian version is served with 
                              chunkier portions of lamb, beef, chicken or salmon, and served with an unleavened bread,
                               Russian pickles and a somtimes spicy tomato sauce. If your travels take you to Moscow's 
                              Izmailovsky flea market, you'll find a range of market stalls serving shashlik sticks 
                              right off the grill</p>

                             <p>Adventurous foodies must try cuy, (pronounced "kwee") which is... guinea pig.
                                While it might seem unconventional to tuck into furry critters better known 
                                as domisticated in the West, this indigenous mammal has been a staple in 
                                Peru's Andean diet for around 5,000 years! When roasted over and open fire 
                                this popular meat is smoky  and tender, covered in crispy skin and delicious 
                                dipped in aji sauce

                              <p>A glance at an unassuming pot of polenta might not evoke enthusiasm, 
                              but the dish is quite a chameleon. Its creamy consistency makes an 
                              excellent base for stews, and there are plenty of sweet and savory ways 
                              to pep it up. Nowadays, the dish is made with ground corn, ranging from 
                              a coarse to flour, but according to <styrong>Italy Heritage</styrong>, a variety of grains 
                              were used in the past. The flour is boiled in water, producing a 
                              porridge-like mash, which <styrong>Italy Heritage</styrong> explains is the source of the name. 
                              Unless you're using instant polenta, the mixture needs to be vigorously 
                              stirred during the hour or so that it boils</p>

                             <p>Souvlaki is considered one of the most popular dishes in Greece!
                              A very important thing to keep in mind with this dish is that it is all about 
                             the place you buy it from. Almost every restuarant has its own unique recipe, 
                             and, as the quality of the meat and sauce really matters, they certainly do 
                             not all taste the same.</p>
                             <p>Souvlaki can be served either wrapped in pita or plated on a dish with any 
                             preffered meat along with french fries, lettuce, tomatoes and its distinctive sauce</p>

                              Doro wat or chicken stew is one of the most popular dishes in Ethiopia and 
                              is often served as part of an Ethiopian restuarant combination platter. 
                              Considered by many to be an Ethiopian national dish, it refers to an extremely 
                              spicy stew made with chicken and hard boiled eggs simmered with garlic ginger, 
                              caramelized onions, tomato paste, and a spicy berbere sauce</p>
